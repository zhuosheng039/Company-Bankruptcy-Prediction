# Company Bankruptcy Prediction: Early Warning System for Corporate Distress

ECE 143 - Group 14

Team Members: Kendra Chen, Zhuosheng Song, Matthew Alegrado, Jinglin Cao

This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of Company Bankruptcy Prediction in a Taiwan dataset, investigating financial indicators that signal corporate distress. The objective is to construct a robust predictive pipeline capable of identifying firms at elevated risk of bankruptcy.

## Primary Task

**Main task**: Build a model pipeline to assess company distress using financial indicators.

We propose a pipeline consisting of PCA-based feature engineering and selection, followed by VIF pruning to remove multicollinearity, then training a classification model to determine whether a company is likely to experience distress given its current business statistics. The pipeline also derives interpretable decision thresholds with SHAP analysis and monitoring rules based on influential financial indicators and visualizes model explanations.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.10. The required modules are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Setting Up the Conda Environment

Follow these steps to create the project environment and install all required dependencies.

#### 1. Create and Activate the Conda Environment (Python 3.10)

```bash
conda create -n Bankruptcy_env python=3.10
conda activate Bankruptcy_env
```
#### 2. Install Depencencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Set up Jupyter Kernel
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=Bankruptcy_env --display-name "Python Bankruptcy_env"
```
Then select the kernel "Python Bankruptcy_env" to run the notebook in the conda environment.

## How to Run
Simply run our notebook, `visualization.ipynb`, to generate the results and plots locally.

For Early Warning System

1. File Mode (Batch Processing)

Use the --file argument to process a CSV file containing company data. The script will automatically clean the column names, run the prediction, and save the full results and flagged records to the output/ directory.

Command:

```bash
python early_warning_system.py --file <path/to/your/input_data.csv>
```

2. Interactive Mode (Single Record)

Use the -i or --interactive flag to enter a mode where you are prompted to manually enter the feature values for a single record. The script will output the prediction and the detailed reason directly to the console.

Command:

```bash
python early_warning_system.py -i
# OR
python early_warning_system.py --interactive
```

3. Sample Usage
   
If you run the script without any arguments, it will run on the sample instances.

## Limitations

Due to limitations in the available dataset, our model may not handle rare or extreme scenarios that were not observed during training. For instance, a company with a debt ratio greater than 1 would, by financial logic, almost certainly be bankrupt. However, our model will incorrectly predict it as low risk.
